Lab Examination (Second Year - Object-Oriented Programming Module)

Overview
This repository contains a lab based practical examination developed for a second year Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module. The project assesses core OOP principles and practical implementation skills.

Key Learning Objectives

Application of fundamental Object-Oriented Principles (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).
Implementation and comparison of sorting mechanisms using Comparator and Comparable interfaces.
Management and manipulation of custom objects within a structured system.
Development of a basic graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.
Event handling through Swing-based action listeners.

Target Audience
This project is designed for individuals with a foundational understanding of procedural oriented programming who are transitioning to object-oriented paradigms. It serves as a practical exercise for reinforcing OOP concepts, GUI development, and event-driven programming in Java.
